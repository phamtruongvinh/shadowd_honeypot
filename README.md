**Shadow Daemon** is a collection of tools to **detect**, **record** and **prevent** **attacks** on *web applications*.
Technically speaking, Shadow Daemon is a **web application firewall** that intercepts requests and filters out malicious parameters.
It is a modular system that separates web application, analysis and interface to increase security, flexibility and expandability.

This is a simple docker-compose wrapper to manage Shadow Daemon installations.

# Requirements

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

# Setup

You can use the following command to start Shadow Daemon:

    sudo ./shadowdctl up -d

Modify the file `docker-compose.yml` for fine-grained control.
For more information about other commands and configuration options check out the [Docker Compose manual](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
